#Ansible Host File

# Masscommand uses standard Ansible hosts file structure to operate
# Make sure your categories line up with host titles in this file. 
# Ex, default masscommand file uses a,b,c,d,e,e2... etc,
# meaning it checks for "_a" "_b" "_c" and so on in each title. 

# You may want to adjust this to something more useful, like "_DC", "_FileServer", etc
# If you do rename your boxes to match this schema, then make sure to adjust categories in the masscommand file
